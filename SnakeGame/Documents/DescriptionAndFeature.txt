Description
The project will be the primary example of displaying the capabilities of the QT gui system. The main focus for this project is to further extend our experience in software engineering, and to apply industry practices in order to send out a shippable product.

This will be a simple snake game. You will play inside a grid where you have to pick up pallets. Each time you pick up those pallets, you will continue to grow. This project will be "data-sturcutre" heavily to laying out the snake's position, how long his is, and the pivot point for each piece the snake to turn. The speed of the snake will be multipied by how long the snake is, making it progressively faster as you go.

Given the production speed of this product, we'll include a dynamic field where the grid size of the game also increases as you get longer. You'll have more room to move around, but the speed will still make it heavily challenging as the player progresses.

The score will be based solely on the amount of steps you take, which the amount of steps you take will be multiplied by how long you are. You get 3 chances whenever you do hit into either yourself, or outside the grid field. The score will reset, and you can still reach your marked hiscore with each chance.

Features
- Using the QT Gui Interface to create our application.
- File Manulation to store the hiscore
- Using a 2-dimensional array to layer our our playing field.
