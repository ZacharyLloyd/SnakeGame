3) Technologies
When it comes down to technologies we will be using Qt as our framework. Qt has a exellent and clean interface that is easy to use, along with customer service and a large library of documentation on how to use use it. We will be programming in C++ because the team, as a whole has more experience in the programming language. To save all our work we will be using GitHub and have muiltiple branches. There will be a branch for each teammate, that will merge to a medary branch will then go to our master branch. To keep everything on track with our project scheduling, we will be using Excel.

4) The first sprint will constist of the team getting the GUI and scripting straight. Meaning we will be settting up the framework  of the project. Our second sprint will be tying everything together such as the GUI and the scripts to make everything work, which will be the challenging part of the project. Our third sprint will consist of the team polishing, testing and clean the project. If we manage to finish early we will probably add features to the games itself, but will see.
